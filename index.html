  <h3>Little background into the art and science of Perfumes</h3>
  The word perfume comes from Latin where per means through and fumum means smoke. Initially, perfumes were used in religious ceremonies, in the form of incense, but eventually, they were used by people to make themselves smell good. The Egyptian
  pharaohs used perfume. Perfumes were found in King Tutankhamen's tomb, and amazingly, the containers still had a fragrance when they were discovered, even though the liquid had evaporated away! The Greeks and Romans also delighted in
  perfumeâ€”wealthy Romans took baths in perfumed water. Until the 19th century, bad smells were thought to be the source of sickness and disease. During outbreaks of the bubonic plague, medieval doctors would protect themselves with masks and
  perfume. In the court of Louis XIV, King of France, bathing in water too often was thought to be unhealthy, so perfumes were used obsessively in order to mask the disagreeable smell in the royal palace.

  <p>
    <b>Perfumes release their fragrances in three steps.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The first step is the head note, which is the first impression that you get when you initially smell the fragrance. </li>
      <li>The heart note, the second step, forms the character of the perfume and is perceivable for 3â€“4 hours. </li>
      <li>The third step is the base note, which forms the foundation of the perfume and can last as long as a whole day. </li>
      <li>Fragrances can have a wide range of volatility. Volatility defines how a substance vaporizes. For instance, in a perfume made from lavender and vanilla fragrances, you will smell the lavender as part of the head note and the vanilla as
        part of the base note, since lavender has a higher volatility than vanilla. .</li>
      <li>Most perfumes are complicated mixtures of several different synthetic or natural fragrances. In fact, many of the scents that are used to make up a perfume are synthetic that is because extracting natural scents from flowers is
        time-consuming and expensive. It can take several pounds of raw plant material to extract just a few ounces of natural oil. There are also many natural sources for fragrances. For example, rose oil is extracted from the flower's petals,
        geranium oil is extracted from the plant's leaves, and cedar oil is extracted from grated cedar wood. Some fragrances have animal sources, like musk and ambergris.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>There are several methods for extracting scents, such as distillation, maceration, expression, and enfleurage (AH-fluh-RAHJ).</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In distillation, the raw material is heated in a chamber and the fragrant compounds are recollected through condensation of the distilled vapor. </li>
    <li>In maceration, the fragrance is extracted by soaking the raw material in water, oil, or a solvent. </li>
    <li>The expression technique is a simple one. The raw materials are simply squeezed or pressed, and the oils are collected. </li>
    <li>Enfleurage is a two-step process during which the odor of aromatic materials is absorbed into wax or fat, and then extracted with alcohol. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What are the different concentrations of perfume?</h3>
  <p>
    Perfume is made up of essential oils and aromatic compounds that are diluted in water or high-grade alcohol. The amount of essential oils, aromatic compounds, and alcohol determine the concentration of the perfume.<p>
      <ul>
        <li>Parfum, Pure Perfume, or Perfume Extract is the highest concentration of perfume, containing 15-40% of aromatic compounds. This is the longest-lasting and purest concentration of perfume.</li>
        <li>Eau de Parfum (EdP), is the most popular concentration of perfume and contains 10-30% aromatic compounds. The scent is resilient and generally less expensive than Perfume Extract.</li>
        <li>Eau de Toilette (EdT) is a light scented fragrance with a solution base of 5-20% aromatic compounds. This provides a refreshing scent that doesnâ€™t linger as long as an EdP. </li>
        <li>Eau de Cologne (EdC) is a less concentrated version of Eau de Toilette with 3-8% aromatic compounds.</li>
      </ul>
